        <h1>What made me decide to study ICT?</h1>
        <p>
          My interest in ICT began when I was in grade 9. At that time, I loved
          playing games, which sparked my curiosity about how they were created.
          This motivated me to start learning ICT and science, and I found the
          subjects very engaging. Through the internet, I also discovered how
          technology connects people across the world and provides access to
          global knowledge, which deepened my interest further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the next few years, I realized that ICT not only makes
          communication and learning easier but also creates opportunities to
          work remotely, just like in a traditional office. This flexibility
          fascinated me. Later, I understood that it is possible to build a
          career by developing games and software, while also earning a living
          from home. To keep up with the modern world, I believe it is essential
          to stay updated with ICT, and this realization further strengthened my
          decision. With these motivations, I chose ICT as my program of study
          and set my goal to become a software developer.

        <h1>Why HZ University of Applied Science?</h1>
        <p>
          I chose HZ University because it focuses on both academic learning and
          practical, hands-on experience. I believe this balance is very
          important, as theoretical knowledge alone is not enough in todayâ€™s
          world. The practical orientation of HZ University ensures that
          students are well-prepared for real-life challenges in their careers,
          which makes it the right place for me to pursue my studies.
